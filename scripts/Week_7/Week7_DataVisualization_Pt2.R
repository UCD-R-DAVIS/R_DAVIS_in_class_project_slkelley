#scale_fill_viridis_b

##need further understanding on different scale_fill_viridis_?

#to use rcolorbrewer palate instead of viridis, use scale_fill_brewer(palette = "set3")

#Finish watching tutorial videos and do tutorial and do homework. Start next week's tutorials as well and do homework so can take advantage in office hours on tuesday before you go on vacation.
